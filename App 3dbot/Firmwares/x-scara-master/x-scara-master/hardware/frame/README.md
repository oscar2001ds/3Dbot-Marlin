Assembly
===

Step 1 - Assemble the bottom plate
---

![bottom plate down](images/assembly/BasePlate_Btm.png)
![bottom plate up](images/assembly/BasePlate_Top.png)

Make sure when you connect these parts that the aluminum profiles have a corect 90ยบ angle, before tightening the screws.

Don't tighten the screws too hard to allow adjustments at the end of the assembly. 
This is especially valid for the Z bearing plate, which requires adjustment of the Z lead screw after the arm
is installed.

Step 2 - Assemble top plate
---

![top plate down](images/assembly/TopPlate_Btm.png)
![top plate up](images/assembly/TopPlate_Top.png)

The top plate is very much similar with the bottom plate, with the exception of the Z-Motor mount. 

Don't tighten the screws too hard for the motor mount. 
Like the bearing plate, it will require adjustments after arm installation.

Step 3 - Assemble the plates on the back frame
---

This is somewhat straight-forward. Make sure the plates are parallel after assembly.

Step 4 - Assemble the rods and lead screw (temporarly)
---

![top plate down](images/assembly/Frame_Complete.png)

This parts will get their final assembly after the arm is fully assembled and installed. 
Place them just to check for missalignments.

Done

Nicely done. Now assemble the [arm](../arm/README.md) if you haven't done so by now.
