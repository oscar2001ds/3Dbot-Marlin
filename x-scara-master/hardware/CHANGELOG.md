Versioning scheme
===
Being work in progress, a versioning scheme will is necessary to identify which parts are part of a working set and which not. 
The versioning scheme used is:

    partname_major_minor_revision.STL

  - all parts with the same major version are compatible
  - increasing minor version indicates a change in the part's geometry
  - any estetical changes will not increase the minor version, just the revision
  - revision is incremented within each update on any X-SCARA part
